### Assumptions

We assume that the staff and students are already registered in the school sysytem and have already been issued with emails.
But because we don't have access to the system to login students or staff and get their data, we opted to register them to generate the data we need.

Analytics: Add to staff dashboard later with a /staff/stats endpoint.
Messaging: Expand with a /staff/message endpoint and UI.
Full Dashboard: Integrate StaffDashboard into your admin panelâ€™s routing
